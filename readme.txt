Locally host gravatars for the privacy-concious.

== Description ==

Allow your users to use gravatars, but without sacrificing their privacy.

The plugin will get your users gravatars and host them locally on your website.
Your visitors will get the gravatars directly from your website instead of the gravatar CDN, therefore increasing privacy and performance.

Note: Gravatars are flushed daily to allow their refreshing, and avoid cluttering the filesystem.
